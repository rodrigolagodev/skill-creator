# Creating Agent Skills

Expert system for creating high-quality Agent Skills following the open standard, with comprehensive templates, validation checklists, and best practices.

## What Are Agent Skills?

**Agent Skills** are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that AI agents can discover and use dynamically to improve their capabilities. Think of them as **plugins for AI agents**.

### Key Benefits

- **Reusable**: Write once, use across multiple agent platforms
- **Discoverable**: Agents can find and activate skills on demand
- **Portable**: Compatible with Claude, OpenCode, Cursor, VS Code, and 20+ platforms
- **Version-controlled**: Skills are just folders → perfect for Git

### The Agent Skills Standard

This skill follows the **[Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io)**, originally developed by Anthropic and adopted by the community.

**Supported platforms:**
- Claude, Claude Code
- OpenCode, Crush
- Cursor, VS Code
- GitHub Copilot
- Gemini CLI, Roo Code, Goose
- And 15+ more...

## Core Principles

### 1. Skills Are Structured Documentation

Skills are **pure markdown documentation** that agents load as context. No executable code required.

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          # Entry point (YAML + Markdown)
├── references/       # Detailed documentation
├── templates/        # Reusable templates
└── workflows/        # Step-by-step guides
```

### 2. YAML Frontmatter + Markdown Body

```yaml
---
name: skill-identifier
description: What it does, when to use, examples
---

# Skill Name

Your instructions here...
```

### 3. Progressive Disclosure

- **SKILL.md**: < 500 lines (quick reference)
- **references/**: Deep dives when needed
- **templates/**: Copy-paste starting points
- **workflows/**: Guided processes

### 4. English-First for LLM Efficiency

Write skills in **English** for optimal LLM performance:
- Faster inference
- Lower token costs
- Better comprehension
- Consistent behavior

## Quick Start

**What would you like to do?**

1. **Create new skill** → Use workflow: [create-new-skill.md](workflows/create-new-skill.md)
2. **Validate existing skill** → Use checklist: [validation-checklist.md](references/validation-checklist.md)
3. **Understand structure** → Read: [skill-anatomy.md](references/skill-anatomy.md)
4. **Copy template** → Start with: [templates/minimal-skill.md](templates/minimal-skill.md)

> **Important:** This skill provides **knowledge and templates**. When creating skills, 
> use the `Write` tool to create files directly in `~/.config/opencode/skills/<name>/`.

**Example Workflow:**
```
User: "Create a skill for analyzing API documentation"
    ↓
1. Agent loads skill-creator for guidance
2. Agent reads templates/minimal-skill.md
3. Agent customizes for API analysis use case
4. Agent uses Write tool to create ~/.config/opencode/skills/api-analyzer/SKILL.md
5. Done! Skill is ready to use
```

## Skill Structure

### Required Files

| File | Required | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `SKILL.md` | ✅ Yes | Entry point with frontmatter + instructions |
| `README.md` | ⚠️ Recommended | GitHub documentation |
| `LICENSE` | ⚠️ Recommended | Open source license (MIT suggested) |

### Optional Directories

| Directory | Purpose | When to Use |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `references/` | Detailed documentation | Complex skills with multiple concepts |
| `templates/` | Reusable starting points | Skills that generate content/code |
| `workflows/` | Step-by-step guides | Multi-step processes |
| `examples/` | Complete examples | Show real usage patterns |

### Minimal Skill Example

```yaml
---
name: example-skill
description: >-
  Demonstrates basic skill structure.
  Use when learning how skills work.
  
  <example>
  User: "Show me a skill example"
  Assistant: "I'll use the example-skill."
  </example>
---

# Example Skill

You are a skill demonstrator. Your purpose is to show how skills work.

## Core Instructions

1. Explain what this skill does
2. Provide clear examples
3. Reference additional resources when needed

## When to Use

Use this skill when users ask about:
- How skills are structured
- Skill creation basics
- Agent Skills standard
```

## Frontmatter Specification

See [references/frontmatter-spec.md](references/frontmatter-spec.md) for complete details.

### Required Fields

```yaml
---
name: skill-identifier        # kebab-case, unique
description: >-               # What, when, examples
  What this skill does.
  When to use it.
  
  <example>...</example>
---
```

### Optional Fields

```yaml
---
license: MIT                  # Or Apache-2.0, BSD-3-Clause
compatibility: opencode       # Or agent-skills-standard, claude, cursor
metadata:
  category: development       # Organization
  version: "1.0.0"           # Semantic versioning
  author: "Your Name"
  tags: [python, testing]
---
```

### Description Best Practices

✅ **Good Description:**
```yaml
description: >-
  Analyzes Python code for security vulnerabilities using static analysis.
  Use when reviewing code, auditing projects, or checking for common CVEs.
  
  <example>
  User: "Check this code for security issues"
  Assistant: "I'll use the security-analyzer skill."
  </example>
```

❌ **Bad Description:**
```yaml
description: Helps with security
```

**Rules:**
- Include **WHAT** it does (1 sentence)
- Include **WHEN** to use (triggers)
- Include at least 1 `<example>` block
- Keep under 1024 characters
- Write in third person

## Naming Conventions

### Skill Names (frontmatter `name`)

Use **kebab-case** with descriptive nouns or verb phrases:

✅ **Good:**
- `code-reviewer`
- `api-documentation`
- `database-migration`
- `security-audit`
- `prompt-engineering`

❌ **Avoid:**
- `helper`, `utils`, `tool` (too vague)
- `my-skill`, `skill1` (not descriptive)
- `CodeReviewer` (wrong case)

### Folder Names

Match your skill's `name` field:

```bash
~/.config/opencode/skills/
├── code-reviewer/           # name: code-reviewer
├── api-documentation/       # name: api-documentation
└── security-audit/          # name: security-audit
```

## Best Practices

### Do's ✅

1. **Write in English** - Optimal for LLM processing
2. **Use clear descriptions** - What + when + examples
3. **Include examples** - Show real usage with `<example>` blocks
4. **Organize content** - Use references/ for deep dives
5. **Provide templates** - Make it easy to get started
6. **Document limitations** - Be explicit about what skill cannot do
7. **Version your skill** - Use semantic versioning (1.0.0)

### Don'ts ❌

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| No examples | Users don't know when to use | Add `<example>` blocks |
| Vague description | Agent won't activate skill | Specific triggers + use cases |
| Monolithic SKILL.md | Overwhelming (>1000 lines) | Split into references/ |
| Executable scripts | Breaks portability | Pure markdown documentation |
| Missing README | Hard to discover on GitHub | Add README.md |
| No versioning | Breaking changes unclear | Use CHANGELOG.md |

## Skill Creation Process

### Method: Direct File Creation

When creating a skill, use the `Write` tool:

```markdown
1. Understand purpose (ask questions if needed)
2. Read template: templates/minimal-skill.md
3. Customize for specific use case
4. Use Write tool to create: ~/.config/opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md
5. (Optional) Add references/, templates/, workflows/ as needed
```

### Guided Workflow

Follow [workflows/create-new-skill.md](workflows/create-new-skill.md) for step-by-step guidance.

**Steps:**
1. **Define purpose** - What problem does it solve?
2. **Choose template** - Start with minimal-skill.md
3. **Customize frontmatter** - Name, description, metadata
4. **Write instructions** - Core capabilities and guidelines
5. **Add examples** - Show real usage patterns
6. **Validate** - Use checklist
7. **Test** - Try with real agent tasks
8. **Iterate** - Refine based on usage

## Success Criteria

A well-structured skill:

- ✅ Has valid YAML frontmatter
- ✅ Description includes triggers and examples
- ✅ Written entirely in English
- ✅ SKILL.md < 500 lines (uses references/ for details)
- ✅ Includes at least 1 usage example
- ✅ Documents what it can and cannot do

## Philosophy

> "A great skill is like a well-written manual:
>  - **Clear** about its purpose (description with examples)
>  - **Focused** on one domain (single responsibility)
>  - **Organized** for easy reference (SKILL.md + references)
>  - **Portable** across platforms (Agent Skills standard)
>  - **Documented** for contributors (README + LICENSE)"

Create skills that are **focused**, **clear**, and **reusable**.
